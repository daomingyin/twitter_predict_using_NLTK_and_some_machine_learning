# twitter_predict_using_NLTK_and_some_machine_learning
This code mainly use NLTK and some machine learning skills to make a forecast,
and mainly use for my own assignment.

There are two codes file, one is use word2vector and LDA to create the dictionary of coronavirous 
and do the sentiment analysis based on that.

Another one is mainly using the machine learning tools to figure out the relationships 
between the sentiment & technical indicator with stock price

The twitter code is scraped and only uploaded the clean version.

The extratreeClassifier is not accurate so i just delete from plot.
